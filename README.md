#ATmega_DS18x20_Tester

**Firmware for Sensor Tester by FSA**

This repo contains the firmware for test equipment brought to us by FSA in spring 2017. The project for this hardware was announced and is documented at "Deutsches Raspberry Pi Forum" (http://www.forum-raspberrypi.de/Thread-projekt-ds18b20-tester-mit-lcd).

The firmware supports several ways to check 1 wires sensors e.g. DS18B20 (https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/DS18B20.pdf) by Dallas Semiconductors (maybe better known as "Maxim Integrated" https://www.maximintegrated.com/en.html).
